In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly within a route's component tree can lead to unexpected behavior.  If the parent component is rendered multiple times without changing the URL, `useParams` will return stale data, resulting in incorrect rendering. This often happens when conditional rendering is used or when components are re-rendered during state updates that don't change the URL itself.
